# Assessing Treatment Regimens in Multiple Myeloma Using R - Part 1: Descriptive Statistics in R

Welcome! This repository supports the analysis of treatment regimens and progression-free survival in multiple myeloma (MM) patients, using R for descriptive statistics.

# Overview
## Focus: 
Using R to calculate and interpret descriptive statistics in MM datasets, focusing on progression-free survival and addressing disparities in outcomes.

# Why This Matters: 
African Americans have a two-fold higher incidence of MM but face systemic barriers to care and understanding data is the first step to addressing these disparities.

# Goals
- Equip researchers with tools to analyze MM data effectively.
- Highlight disparities in treatment outcomes for African Americans.
- Provide actionable insights to improve equity in MM care.
